# Hammerspoon

Hammerspoon becomes a single "router" to all the automation and UI customization on my Mac.

## Use Cases

- Fullscreen window arrangement

## Prerequisites

The hammerspoon configuration uses [Hyper.spoon](https://github.com/evantravers/dotfiles/tree/master/users/evantravers/.config/hammerspoon/Spoons/Hyper.spoon#-installation) which has to be installed manually (currently).
