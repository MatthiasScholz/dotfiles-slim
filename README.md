# Dotfiles

Going to track some dotfiles that may not need security or generation.

If you have gnu `stow`, just clone this to `~/.dotfiles/`, then run `stow
[name]` to install a dotfile.

## TODOS

- Handle installation of common packages via `brew bundle`
  - Add common apps via brew? (bartender, dropbox, alfred?)
- Handle customization of files by adding user secrets on install (maybe a
  makefile that stops for input?) Maybe Ansible.
